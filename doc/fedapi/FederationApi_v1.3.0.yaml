    # Definitions
    ---
    This section provides definitions of terminologies commonly referred to throughout the API descriptions.

    * __Accepted Zones__ - List of partner OP zones, which the originating OP has confirmed to use for its edge applications
    * __Anchoring__ - Partner OP capability to serve application clients (still in their home location) from application instances running on partner zones.

    * __Availability Zone__ - Zones that partner OP can offer to share with originating OP.
    * __Device__ - Refers to user equipment like mobile phone, tablet, IOT kit, AR/VR device etc. In context of MEC users use these devices to access edge applications
    * __Directed Federation__ - A Federation between two OP instances A and B, in which edge compute resources are shared by B to A, but not from A to B.
    * __Edge Application__ - Application designed to run on MEC edge cloud
    * __Edge Discovery Service__ - Partner OP service responsible to select most optimal edge( within partner OP) for edge application instantiation. Edge discovery service is defined as HTTP based API endpoint identified by a well-defined FQDN or IP.
    * __E/WBI__ - East west bound interface.
    * __Federation__ - Relationship among member OPs who agrees to offer services and capabilities to the application providers and end users of member OPs
    * __FederationContextId__ - Partner OP defined string identifier representing a certain federation relationship.

    * __FileId__ - An OP defined string identifier representing a certain application image uploaded by an application provider
    * __Flavour__ - A group of compute, network and storage resources that can be requested or granted as a single unit
    * __FlavourIdentifier__ - An OP defined string identifier representing a set of compute, storage and networking resources
    * __Home OP__ - Used in federation context to identify the OP with which the application developers or user clients are registered.
    * __Home Routing__ - Partner OP capability to direct roaming user client traffic towards application instances running on home OP zones.
    * __Instance__ - Application process running on an edge
    * __LCM Service__ - Partner OP service responsible for life cycle management of edge applications. LCM service is defined as HTTP based API endpoint identified by a well-defined FQDN or IP.
    * __Offered Zones__ - Zones that partner OP offer to share to the Originating OP based on the prior agreement and local configuration.
    * __Onboarding__ - Submitting an application to MEC platform
    * __OP__ - Operator platform.
    * __OperatorIdentifier__ - String identifier representing the owner of MEC platform. Owner could be an enterprise, a TSP or some other organization
    * __Originating OP__ - The OP when initiating the federation creation request towards the partner OP is defined as the Originating OP
    * __Partner OP__ - Operator Platform which offers its Edge Cloud capabilities to the other Operator Platforms via E/WBI.
    * __Resource__ - Compute, networking and storage resources.
    * __Resource Pool__ - A group of compute, networking and storage resources. Application provider pre-reserve resources on partner OP zone, these resources are reserved in terms of flavours.
    * __ZoneIdentifier__ - An OP defined string identifier representing a certain geographical or logical area where edge resources and services are provided
    * __Zone Confirmation__ - Procedure via which originating OP acknowledges partner OP about the partner zones it wishes to use.
